        <div id="left" class="bubble">Hello there! Today, we are going to talk 
            about something called the "discount rate." Now, I know that sounds like a big, fancy term, 
            but don't worry - it's actually quite easy to understand once we break it down together! 
            Imagine that your piggy bank has $50 today, and you expect to have $60 in one year 
            because you will save $10 each month. But what if someone asked you, 
            "How much is that extra $10 worth to me now?" That's where the discount rate comes in! 
            It helps us figure out how much that money is worth today instead of waiting for tomorrow. 
            So, let's define the discount rate: Discount rate = A special interest rate used to find out
             how much money received in the future is worth today. Now, you might wonder, "Why do we need 
             this magical number?" Well, it's crucial when adults make decisions about whether to invest 
             their money in things like building new schools, starting businesses, or even buying toys! 
             By using the discount rate, grown-ups can compare different opportunities and choose the best 
             ones. Next up, let's see how we calculate the discount rate with a simple formula: Future Value / 
             (1 + Discount Rate)^Number of Years = Present Value Don't panic! We won't dive into those strange 
             symbols just yet. Instead, let's think of them as tools to help us answer questions like, "Is it 
             better to have $50 right now or wait a year to get $60?" If we rearrange the formula, we can discover 
             the discount rate: (Future Value / Present Value) ^ (1 / Number of Years) - 1 = Discount Rate Let's try 
             an example with our piggy bank scenario: You have $50 today, and you'll have $60 in one year ($10 saved
              per month). So, what's the discount rate for getting that extra $10 immediately instead of waiting a 
              whole year? Using the formula: ($60 / $50) ^ (1 / 1) - 1 = Discount Rate = 1.2 ^ 1 - 1 = 1.2 - 1 = 0.2 
              or 20% Wow! That means if someone offered to give you an extra $10 immediately instead of having to wait 
              a year, it would be like earning a 20% return on investment. Sounds pretty good, huh? And remember, the
               discount rate isn't just for piggy banks; grown-ups use it all the time to decide which projects are 
               worthy of their hard-earned dollars. Pretty cool, right?
             Thanks for joining me on this journey through the world of the discount rate!</div>
        <div id="center" class="bubble">Hello young scholars! Today, 
            let's talk about something fun and useful - functions and their inverses. You may wonder, 
            "What are those?" Well, imagine you have a magic box that changes every number you put into it. T
            his magic box or "function" takes your number, performs some secret operation, and gives you a new number. 
            An "inverse" function undoes whatever the magic box did so you can get back your original number. Cool, 
            huh?! Now, there's a rule for creating our special magic boxes. A function should follow the 'One Input, 
            One Output' rule. That means if you give it a 3, it cannot spit out both a 6 and a 10; it must give either a 
            6 or a 10, but consistently. Functions that follow this rule are called 'one-to-one.' So, why can't all functions 
            have an inverse? Imagine having two different magic boxes doing opposite things. When you put in a 2, sometimes one 
            box returns a 4 while the other returns a 6 – which output should the inverse choose? It can't decide because these 
            conflicting boxes broke our 'One Input, One Output' rule. Thus, a function doesn’t have an inverse if it's not a 
            one-to-one function. To check if our magic box follows the rule, draw some lines horizontally across its picture 
            (the 'graph'). If any line touches the graph at more than one spot, then the function isn't one-to-one and won't
             have an easy-peasy inverse. But if no line crosses the graph twice, congratulations! Your function obeys the rule,
              and it deserves a fantastic inverse! Let's practice finding the inverses of some friendly grade-school functions 
            together soon! Keep exploring, keep learning!</div>
        <div id="right" class="bubble">Let's delve into the 
            concept of linear interpolation and its application in finding interest rates, using the dialogue between 
            the users "ainster31" and "Ray Vickson." We will break down the conversation to grasp the underlying 
            mathematical principles and methods. Linear interpolation is a technique used to estimate values between 
            two known points in a dataset. It fits a straight line through these two points and uses this line to 
            approximate unknown values within the interval spanned by those points. This approach is particularly 
            useful when trying to determine the root (zero) of a function, which is what the user "ainster31" was 
            interested in discovering. To apply linear interpolation mathematically, first, identify the two known 
            points ($x_1, f_1$) and ($x_2, f_2$). These points correspond to the values where your function is defined. 
            Next, calculate the slope of the linear function passing through them: $$\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=
            \frac{f_2-f_1}{x_2-x_1}.$$ After determining the slope, you can express the linear function in point-slope form, 
            which looks like this: $$f(x)=f_1+\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}(x-x_1).$$ Now, if you want to find the root (denoted as
             $x_0$) of the linear function, set $f(x)$ equal to zero and solve for $x$: $$f(x_0)=\cancel{f}_1-\cancel{f}_1\cdot
             \left(\frac{x_0-x_1}{x_2-x_1}\right)^{-1}=0.$$ Simplifying leads to the following expression: $$\frac{x_0-x_1}
             {x_2-x_0}=-\frac{f_1}{f_2},$$ from which you can isolate $x_0$: $$x_0=\frac{f_2x_1-f_1x_2}{f_2-f_1}.$$ 
             Returning to our initial example, "ains" asked about computing the Net Present Worth (NPW), 
             specifically regarding how linear interpolation was utilized in this computation. By employing 
             the formula above, you can find the present worth factor ($x_0$), taking into account different 
             interest rates. Once obtained, multiply the net cash inflows by the 
            corresponding present worth factors and sum up the results to obtain the total Net Present Worth (NPW).</div>
